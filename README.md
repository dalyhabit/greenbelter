# Greenbelter

This web-app displays useful information about the Barton Creek Greenbelt in Austin, TX. It will eventually be hosted at greenbelter.io.

## Directions

Most people who live in Austin know about the Greenbelt, but few know where each swimming hole is and how to get to each one. This project aims to solve that problem. Greenbelter features driving directions to the entrance to each swimming hole and walking directions from the entrance to the swimming hole. The swimming holes featured in this project are:

..*Hill of Life Dam
..*Sculpture Falls
..*Twin Falls
..*Campbell's Hole
..*Gus Fruh
..*The Flats

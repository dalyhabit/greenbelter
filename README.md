# Greenbelter ‚òÄÔ∏è üçÉ üèû

This web-app displays useful information about the Barton Creek Greenbelt in Austin, TX. It will eventually be hosted at greenbelter.io.

## Directions

Most people who live in Austin know about the Greenbelt, but few know where each swimming hole is and how to get to each one. This project aims to solve that problem. Greenbelter features driving directions to the entrance to each swimming hole and walking directions from the entrance to the swimming hole. The swimming holes featured in this project are:

* Hill of Life Dam
* Sculpture Falls
* Twin Falls
* Campbell's Hole
* Gus Fruh
* The Flats

## Water Status

Another problem people encounter when going to the Greenbelt is not knowing whether the creek will be swimmable when they get there. It sucks to hike for 30 minutes through the woods expecting to be rewarded with running water, only to find a dry creekbed. The water level and flow rate of the Barton Creek Greenbelt fluctuates frequently and depends greatly on recent rainfall.

Greenbelter uses live data from the USGS to display the water depth and flow rate at various points in the creek. Flow rates are measured in cubic feet per second, and water depth is measured in feet. For a moving body of water to be considered safe to swim in, the flow rate must measure between 10 and 250 cubic feet per second, but when venturing into anything above 150cfs, use caution. When water is moving slower than 10cfs, there is the possibility of bacteria forming from standing water. It is possible to go tubing/kayaking on the greenbelt when the flow rate is between 150 and 300cfs, but please use extreme caution when doing so.

The point at which flow rates and water depth are measured are:

* Barton Creek at SH 71 near Oak Hill
* Barton Creek at Lost Creek Blvd.
* Barton Creek at Loop 360
* Barton Creek above Barton Springs
